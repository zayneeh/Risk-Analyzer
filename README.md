# Risk-Analyzer

This tool helps legal professionals, petitioners, and immigration assistants evaluate the risk of receiving a Request for Evidence (RFE) in EB-1A immigration petitions. It uses a combination of heuristic checks and AI-based legal reasoning (via OpenAI GPT-4) to review petition documents and provide a structured risk analysis report.
